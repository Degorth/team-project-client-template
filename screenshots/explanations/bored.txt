Bored:
The bored page is laid out with one randomly generated event in the center
of the page. This event panel includes the event name, location, event holders,
and contact information. Below this panel are two buttons, one to add the event
to your schedule, and another to generate another event to attend. The generated
events are soon-to-come events, so that the user can use this page to find something
to do in a moment's time.

homepage scrn:
The homepage screen is pretty straightforward. It contains the head nav bar.
It also has two panels. The first panel tells the user what events they have
scheduled for later that day. It contains links to those events UGOEvent pages.
The second panel prompts the user to review events they've attended in the past
but have not yet reviewed.
